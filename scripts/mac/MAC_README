Follow these instructions to use the script build system to automatically build the code and publish it to the webserver.

1. Preparation
==============

These steps have to be done once. They are required for setting up your user build environment.

- Copy the file mac_env.template.sh to mac_env.user.sh and open it.
- Follow the instructions in the file to set up the paths correctly.
- Add the ssh key for the webserver to your keychain.

2. Build and publish
====================

Always repeat this steps if you want to publish a new version.

- cd to the scripts/mac
- run ./macPublish to build and publish the versions automatically to the webspace.

3. Hints (optional)
====================

You can also do single steps of the whole progress by using ./macMake.sh (the actual script) with options
 -c clear the old build
 -b compile and build binary
 -d make the dmg file
 -u upload the files to the server
 -t release translations
 -v update the version in all files

4. Issues (optional)
====================

If you get ask for a passwort this means there is the ssh-key missing in your keychain for uploading to the webspace. Consider to add the ssh-key.
